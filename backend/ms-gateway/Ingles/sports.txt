Homework: Speech referring to my personal attitude towards sports (1-2 minutes)

First of all, for me, sports is a way to disconnect from the world, is my way to stay healthy. When I was diagnose (daiagonoust) thrombosis, and I couldn´t walk, I started to understand how important is to do something with your body, to move even just 30 minutes per day. On the one hand, it helps me with my physical health, helping me to maintain an appropriate body weight, and make me understand what my body needs. On the other hand, it improves my mental health, it makes me feels relax from the very moment I dress up for the gym, and there I have time to think and reflex about what is going on in my life. At last but not least, I enjoy watching sports, like football, or hockey, it enriches me with the good vibes of the match.
