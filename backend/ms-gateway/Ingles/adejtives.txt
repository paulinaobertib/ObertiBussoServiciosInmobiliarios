Describir a alguien de mi familia cercana -> incluir la definition del adjetivo

I'm going to describe the most hard-working person I know. She is absolutely persistent, it doesn’t matter if she’s tired or fed up with something, she will always find a way to get what she wants or needs. She’s also extremely concerned with family matters; she always wants us to be together and do something as a family at least once a week.
Even though she can be bossy, she always wants what’s best for me. That’s why she tries to tell me what to do, even if I don’t ask for her advice, and to be fair, that also makes her really reliable, because I deeply know that she always wants what is best for me.
Her life hasn’t been easy; in fact, it never was. But somehow, she found the strength to push through it all. She is one of the strongest person I know.
She can also be very dramatic sometimes and make a big deal out of nothing, but she always finds a way to resolve everything, she is definitely a practical person.
She’s also moody and stubborn, and sometimes a little immature, especially when we argue, but I reckon that’s normal between sisters.
She is my role model, even if she doesn’t know it. She makes me feel self-confident, happy, calm, and optimistic whenever we’re together, or at least most of the time. I’m not going to lie: she also makes me feel stressed and mad sometimes, but I consider that part of our relationship too.
To sum everything up, I’ll just say this: she is one of the most beautiful people I have ever met.
