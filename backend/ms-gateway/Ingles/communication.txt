Prepare a summary of the audio. The woman opinion. My opinion to communicate effective cross-cultural.

to be engaged

As regards effective cross-cultural communication, I believe that in every country the culture is different, if you go to another country, you have to learn about what is acceptable and what is not. At the same time, travelling will improve your acknowledgment about other cultures, and it can even lead to expanding and enriching your social life. However, is not easy to learn about other cultures, because it involves far more than reading about other countries from a book or in internet, you may ask another people from the country, or people that traveled there about their opinions, because is so easy to put your foot in it. Personally, I´m keen on learning about other cultures!
